Julian is an interactive web application that facilitates conversions between Gregorian dates and their corresponding Julian day of the year. Users can input either a Gregorian date or a Julian day, and the application will provide the equivalent counterpart. Julian also offers the ability to copy the displayed date or Julian day to the clipboard.

## ðŸ”§ Usage

Users can select a date from the displayed calendar widget, which will then generate the corresponding Julian day of the year. Alternatively, a Julian day (from 1 to 365/366) or a Gregorian date (in MM/DD/YYYY format) can be input, and the application will update the calendar to the relevant date and provide the corresponding Julian day or date.

Julian offers a seamless user experience, with automatic updates of the date and Julian day as input values are changed. Additionally, the copy functionality allows users to quickly utilize the converted dates/Julian days in their workflow.
